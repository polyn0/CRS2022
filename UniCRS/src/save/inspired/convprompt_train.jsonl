{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy it. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements.

{"pred": "System: Oh, I like documentaries too. What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: Interesting, not very many people that I know like those sort of films, but I do."}
{"pred": "System: My favorite is <movie>, it's a very good movie.", "label": "System: Well, even though I'm young in age, I do think older documentaries are still the best that has been done. Even though I would not classify this documentary as fun in a joyful manner, it is informative about a serious topic, the Holocuast. The documentary is called <movie>."}
{"pred": "System: It's about a group of people who were forced to endure a genocide to save their lives.", "label": "System: A general documentary about how the whole process of genocide against European Jews was carried. The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s. The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the bystanders that saw their neighbors being removed. He also includes the input of prominent historians."}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: Although I forgot to mention a very important fact about the documentary that deters people from watching, It has to be seen on different sittings because it runs close to 9.5 hours, which I think reflects the seriousness of the subject is addressing."}
{"pred": "System: I have not, but I have seen the documentary and I think it is a good one.

{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: Well, I think my fits perfectly your movie preferences. It is subtitled, obviously, but as a film buff I do check lists that come out in which critics rank their favorite movies and <movie> consistently ranks as one of the best, if not the best, documentary of all time."}
{"pred": "System: I haven't seen it, but I've seen the trailer and it sounds interesting. I'll definitely check it out.", "label": "System: Unfortunately no, I had not even heard of it. As you mentioned liking historically accurate, I do enjoy those as well. Although they might not be presented from the viewpoint of an important figure, they usually revolve around a important event like The Biggest Short with Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Christian Bale. It presents a point of view about what led to the 2008 economic crash."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy <movie>. It's a very good movie.", "label": "System: How about earlier movies about earlier periods like the 1500s?"}
{"pred": "System: I think <movie> is a good one. It's about a guy who is trying to find a way to make money.", "label": "System: Well, this is a movie not a documentary. But I consider it one of my favorite movies of all time. It's called <movie> It came out in 1972 and the reason why I like is because, even though it's not based on a specific, single reliable event, it's based on the idea among some Spanish conquistadores that there was hidden city made of gold (El Dorado) in the <movie>. I really appreciate the German director attempt to recreate that period."}

{"pred": "System: What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: Hmm....well lets try to narrow that down a bit. There are all kinds of different comedies and some people prefer a certain kind. I, for one, am a fan of stand up. But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would really enjoy the movie <movie>. It's a comedy with a lot more comedy.", "label": "System: Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies?"}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend watching the movie <movie>. It's a very good movie about a world of war and war.", "label": "System: I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh, I'm sorry I'm not sure if you're familiar with the movie. I'm going to recommend it to you.", "label": "System: Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team!"}

I'm sure you'll be able to find a trailer for that movie if you're interested.", "label": "System: Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler!"}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it! I'm not sure if I can recommend it to you.", "label": "System: I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy."}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. It's about a guy who is in a coma and has to find a new job.", "label": "System: Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself."}
{"pred": "System: That's great! I'm glad you're enjoying it!", "label": "System: Oh my. So you already HAD the tissues on hand! Well it's a good thing then cause I know for a fact this movie has squeezed some tears out of me, no matter how great of a mood I was in when I started watching it."}

{"pred": "System: I'm not sure if I can tell you the plot but it's pretty good. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: Of course! I suppose using today's standards, it would be considered a dramedy (drama comedy) and is traces the life of Midler's character who teamed up with Caan's character, <movie> <movie>, who was a famous entertainer. He thinks he needs something to help bolster his act so he enlists the help of <movie> Leonard, Midler's character. They primarily get together to train US <movie> during the war."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, they do. They are trained to train the soldiers to train their skills and they are trained in the military. They also train their own skills.", "label": "System: Oh gosh. I'm sorry, not train, entertain....my goodness. Please forgive my mind!"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a comedy.", "label": "System: Yes! I know its not a popular stance, but I adore her voice. Its so soulful!"}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie! I'm not sure if it's a good movie or not, but it's definitely worth watching!", "label": "System: Well hopefully the trailer sells you completely. Though I'm sure you'll love it!"}
{"pred": "System: I would!", "label": "System: I always encourage people to watch trailers because there can always be that one thing that they can see in the trailer that can make them excited to see it or hesitant. Either way, I'd rather walk into something with somewhat of an idea of what I'm walking into."}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie! I'm not sure if I'll be able to watch it but I'm hoping I can find something that will make me laugh.", "label": "System: Watch it at your leisure! If you have the opportunity to see it when the chat ends, go for it!"}

I think <movie> is a great movie.", "label": "System: I don't watch comedies as much as horror movies, but my favorite would probably South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut.

I'm not sure if I can find a good movie that's not a comedy but I'm open to suggestions.", "label": "System: I guess the old 80's IT would be an example of that. It was never intended to be a comedy.

{"pred": "System: I think you will like it! It is a great movie!", "label": "System: This movie is based off of the first novel in a seven novel series! I really hope they make movies out of the sequels. This, in my opinion, was an underrated film. It isn't as crazy intricate as Marvel/DC movies are, but it definitely does have very exciting sequences and puts a nice little smile on your face at the end. The trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_U6ctjOaic"}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend watching the movie <movie>. It's a great movie and I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: Yes! Have you ever seen the movie <movie> with Will Smith?

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: Awesome! Historical films are a little bit tougher, since most of the recent historical films seem to all revolve around major wartime events, for example, the movie 1917 that is going to be releasing soon. However, I have a film you may be interested that isn't quite war based! There is a movie named <movie> that is available on Netflix! It has received some great reviews, especially for it's cinematography and beautiful camera shots. It has an impressive cast."}
{"pred": "System: It's about a man who is a superhero and a superhero. It's a very good movie.", "label": "System: The story is about Hal, son of King Henry, who is a wayward prince and he reluctantly becomes King after his father passes away. He has to adapt to everything that a King is responsible for: politics, war, relationships, and ruling people!"}
{"pred": "System: It is! It is a comedy with a lot of action and action. It is about a man who is trying to save his son.", "label": "System: That is interesting you say that! While the actor, Timothee Chalamet is not in Game of Thrones, the movie has a LOT of similarities with Game of Thrones! A lot of people that watched that movie enjoyed it because they enjoy the rawness that the movie has, much like Game of Thrones!"}
{"pred": "System: It is a new film that is coming out this year. It is based on a book called The King, and it is a great movie!", "label": "System: The movie is already out! It is in some select theaters, but you can watch it on Netflix, it is already on there."}

{"pred": "System: Do you like movies with a lot of action?", "label": "System: Have you seen <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: Did you see the movie <movie>?", "label": "System: Ok, what about <movie>? It's a Kubrick film so it may not be for everyone."}
{"pred": "System: Yes I remember him in that film.", "label": "System: Wasn't it Matthew Modine?"}
{"pred": "System: Yes. He was a great actor.", "label": "System: R Lee Ermey I think it was"}
{"pred": "System: He's been in a lot of movies.", "label": "System: That's terrible. Going back a bit a couple I can think of are The Longest Day, <movie> is really good and a newer film is <movie>."}

{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. It's about a man who is a war hero and a war veteran.", "label": "System: There is actually no trailer for that sadly..."}
{"pred": "System: I love that movie! I love the Avengers. Have you seen the movie <movie>?", "label": "System: Do you normally prefer movies based on comics?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would really enjoy <movie>. It's a very action packed movie.", "label": "System: What do you like about them?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would really like Avengers:Dance. It's a very fast paced action movie.", "label": "System: Same here! <movie> is a really great origin story, but if you like an action-packed comedy, I'd really recommend Zombieland 2."}
{"pred": "System: It's about a group of teenagers who are trying to save the world from a mob of criminals. They're trying to take down the mafia.", "label": "System: It pretty much shows how the Joker fit into society when he was trying to function as a normal human being, and it gives insight on his mental illness and background as a clown-like character. It is kind of dark, which definitely makes sense to his character."}
{"pred": "System: The plot is a little bit different but it's a very action packed movie. It's about a group of people who are trying to make a plan to take over the world.", "label": "System: Zombieland 2 is a sequel to Zombieland, where strangers are brought together as a survival team in the zombie apocalypse. The second movie shows them years later as they have grown into more of a family unit, and some drama threatens their relationship."}

{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a great movie. It's a very good movie! It's about a group of people who are trying to survive together.", "label": "System: I did see the first film, but everything is explained pretty well in the second one so you wouldn't need to see the first film to understand."}
{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: Great! I think you'll enjoy it."}
{"pred": "System: What is the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: Do you like superhero movies?"}
{"pred": "System: I like sci-fi movies. What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: James Bond movies are a great option for that, and there are a ton of those movies to choose from."}
{"pred": "System: I really like the new Bond movie, I think it's a great one.", "label": "System: My personal favorite is <movie>, one of the more contemporary ones. However, <movie> is close second and came out in the 60's, so pretty old!"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. I think that is a great movie.", "label": "System: I'm glad to hear that! I hope you enjoy it."}
{"pred": "System: It is a great film.", "label": "System: It appears I can't find the film anywhere online, I think <movie> would be a great second choice if that works for you. In my opinion, Daniel Craig is an even better Bond than Sean Connery."}
{"pred": "System: Great! I'm sure you'll enjoy it!", "label": "System: Of course, it was my pleasure."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I have.", "label": "System: I dont think I have, what year did it come out?"}

{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: That's a great recommendation, thank you! I was a big fan of Austin Powers as a kid, but I think I saw it a little too young as a lot of the jokes went over my head."}
{"pred": "System: What type of movies do you like?", "label": "System: Hmm depends. What kinda genre are you looking for?"}
{"pred": "System: What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: Oh those are good ones! What was the last one you watched?"}
{"pred": "System: I've seen that one too. It was a good one. I really liked the story line.", "label": "System: That was a good movie! You must like the edge of your-seat-kind of suspense. I'd totally recommend the movie <movie>!"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie about a group of people who are trying to find a cure for a disease.", "label": "System: It's a man that has around 25 different personalities that are trying to make the world pure. Watching the actor shift between characters really plays with your mind."}
{"pred": "System: I think you would like it. It's about a man who has a lot of different personalities and is trying to figure out what to do with the world.", "label": "System: He's James McAvoy, he's also the younger Professor X from the X-Men movies. He dd an amazing job jumping between characters. He's the only actor ever to play so many in one film."}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend The Avengers, <movie>, and The Avengers.", "label": "System: Hands down would be Deadpool and <movie> especially if you love the X-Men!"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a very similar story to the first movie.", "label": "System: Only a little. It pushes more as a continuation from the first one. <movie> actually gets a team together and learns the meaning of family."}
{"pred": "System: I think he's a great actor and a great addition to the cast.", "label": "System: To be honest, I haven't seen it yet but it's on my top list! I know it doesn't follow the DC line but it puts a human face to <movie> which is something that has never been done. I love that kind of in depth cinema. I can't wait to see it."}
{"pred": "System: I think it was a little bit of a different story but it was very well made. I think the story is great.", "label": "System: That movie was insane! Utterly graphically insane! I loved it!! The did such a well rounded end it was such a surprise."}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it!", "label": "System: Aww fantastic! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!"}
{"pred": "System: I love action movies! I like a lot of action movies and comedies.", "label": "System: That is one of my favorite genres as well. Have you seen the <movie> movie series?"}
{"pred": "System: The John Wick series. It is a great movie.", "label": "System: John Wick 3: Parabellum"}
{"pred": "System: It's about a man who has to find out what he's doing with his life and his plan to save his life.", "label": "System: It is about a hitman going for revenge. Starring Keanu Reeves."}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend The Last Samurai. It is a very good movie and a great movie to watch.", "label": "System: Do you like the Avengers movies? They are some of my favorites as well."}
{"pred": "System: Avengers: Endgame", "label": "System: Avengers: End Game"}
{"pred": "System: The movie is about the Avengers.", "label": "System: It is about the group of super heroes called the Avengers trying to prevent the end of the world caused by Thanos."}
{"pred": "System: The Avengers.", "label": "System: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth."}
{"pred": "System: I think the plot of <movie> is better.", "label": "System: I would say that Avengers: End Game has a more interesting plot, while John Wick 3 has more realistic action sequences."}
{"pred": "System: John Wick III is the best.", "label": "System: I believe that Avengers: End game has a stronger cast. It is filled with stars that everyone would recognize."}
{"pred": "System: What kind of movies are you into?", "label": "System: see any good ones lately?"}
{"pred": "System: I've seen that one too. It was really good. I've heard it was good. What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: Ha, Did you see It chapter 2?"}
{"pred": "System: I love it! I saw it last week and it was hilarious! I really enjoyed it.", "label": "System: Hilarious and scary! How about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie! It's about a man who's trying to get out of a mental illness and he's got to find out what happens to his family.", "label": "System: I thought it was weird, but falls into horror"}
{"pred": "System: Have you seen the new movie The Witch?", "label": "System: How about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh, I love that movie.", "label": "System: Yes, that was good, have you seen the Purge?"}

{"pred": "System: That's a good idea. I'm not sure if I can find a good movie for you.", "label": "System: Excellent choice of name! I'll take it you've already got Rise of Skywalker on your calendar"}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it.", "label": "System: The part that got me in that one was the Leia/<movie> bit."}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it.", "label": "System: Let's see what happens in this next one. Are you a Browncoat, by chance?"}
{"pred": "System: I'm not a fan of the color red color, but it's a good one.", "label": "System: Thoughts on a reboot of <movie>? Another sequel of sorts? Perhaps focusing on Kaylee?"}
{"pred": "System: I think it's a good one.", "label": "System: Why the skepticism? I don't disagree, just curious to learn your thoughts on the matter"}

Got some interesting family dynamics, which is also important in all of the good coming of age films, etc. Definitely far from a conventional horror narrative and it is willing to push boundaries, so that gives off the indie vibe, etc. Think you might like it!"}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it. I think it's a great movie!", "label": "System: Got it. Nice! The next suggestion isn't quite coming-of-age, but definitely small-budget and terrifying in a psychological thriller kind of way... Ever seen <movie> by Darren Aronofsky?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie about a family that is in a relationship with a girl who is a little bit obsessed with her family. It's about a girl that is a bit obsessed.", "label": "System: Seen ANY Aronofsky films? They all have some thematic similarities. Pi is about a guy's obsession with number theory, to summarize it VERY briefly."}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll enjoy it. I'm not sure if it's a horror or horror movie though.", "label": "System: I definitely suggest Pi then. It's a little more claustrophobic than <movie>, but in a way that suits the obsession theme well."}

I'm not sure if you have seen the movie yet but I'm sure you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: I watched the ones with Toby McGuire when I was younger, and those are amazing too. But I actually really love what they have done with the new version of Spiderman. In Spiderman <movie>, Peter <movie> is kind of like a geeky, weak high-school student who doesn't have a lot going for him until he becomes Spiderman! It's a refreshing twist on Spiderman in my opinion; it's a retelling, not a replacement for Toby McGuire's famous Spiderman!"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, Stan Lee is the main character. He's the main actor of Spider Man.", "label": "System: He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third <movie> Movie, <movie>. I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in <movie>: Civil War before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming.

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy the movie! I think it's about a guy who is a superhero and a superhero.", "label": "System: Then I think my final recomendation will actually be <movie>. I know you like science fiction and the Avengers, so I feel like this is logically the next best movie for you to watch! Spiderman isn't in this movie, but he appears in the next one; however, you have to watch the Avengers movies in order to understand what's going on in them. So what do you think?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will too. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: I did! Doesn't Scarlette Johanson star as Black Widow? I don't know a lot about her storyline, but she is definitely amazing in her role as Black Widow! She appears in the subsequent <movie>'s movies as well, so you should enjoy her in those."}

The story takes place in Nazi Germany during World War II and she is great in her role as the mother of the boy. If you ever have time, <movie> is still in theaters and it's a must see!"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie. It's about a woman who is a young girl who is in a coma and is trying to find her way back to her home.", "label": "System: Yeah, it's a comedy movie about a little boy in Nazi Germany who has <movie> as an imaginary friend. After he finds out that his mom is hiding a Jewish girl in their house, he slowly changes his ideologies to fit less with Hitler's. It's a great movie and I'd highly recommend.

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. It is a great movie.", "label": "System: I would tell you to give it a shot. Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an <movie>.

{"pred": "System: It was a very tense and tense movie. It was very tense, but I think it was a great movie.", "label": "System: Not at all. It is dark for sure. It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going. It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it."}
{"pred": "System: I don't think so. I think it was a little bit of a plot twist.", "label": "System: Yes. Indina Manzel (sp?) is his wife and Judd Hirsh is his father-in-law. The other actors are people who I have seen in other things, but don't know them by name but you will recognize them."}

{"pred": "System: Have you seen the movie <movie>?", "label": "System: Perfect! I think based on your fondness of drama and suspense, you would greatly enjoy <movie>. <movie> stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson.

{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. I think you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: Ah, that's a pretty decent one. If you liked that movie, i'd recommend a movie called <movie> that came out in 2018.It's got somewhat of a similar ruined man finding his life improved by an implant type theme to it."}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. I think you'll enjoy it. I'm not sure if it's a good movie though.", "label": "System: Awesome! I highly recommend it. You have a great night!"}

{"pred": "System: I think ive watched it, it was good!", "label": "System: Let's see..the sequels to Sleep Away <movie> are pretty bad but good also. If you know what I mean. That cheesey horror type deal. Oh! inner space starring a young Dennis Quad is amazing! I highly recommend it."}

{"pred": "System: You're welcome!", "label": "System: Sure thing. Do you like only comedies? Do you like dark humor too?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. It is a great movie.", "label": "System: Thank you. I know the Stranger one sounds less exciting, but I like Will Ferrell in this one a bunch because it is unlike any of his other rolls. Just like Jim Cary in Eternal Sunshine.

{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: Yeah, you gotta have a story to keep you interested. I think <movie> has a story that is interesting and fits the season as well."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. It's a very good movie.", "label": "System: Sure. A young woman (Emilia Clarke from <movie>) is working as an elf at a store and nothing's going right for her. It is terrible to be alone during the season, and then suddenly she meets someone and things turn around for her. What do you think?"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a little bit of a twist.", "label": "System: Well there is a twist, but I won't give it away. Anyhow, do you think such a movie would be something you're interested in seeing?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like it. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: Now i want to watch it! Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching <movie>. The film is dark but has funny aspects to it. Plus its the sequel the original, <movie>."}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: Yup! I love his movies. If you have Netflix definetely watch, <movie>. It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over. I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie. LOL"}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: No problem. I'm a huge movie person. I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw. I can't handle those. I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking. Since you like suspense i also recommend watching <movie>."}
{"pred": "System: I'm not a fan. I think you'll like it. I really enjoyed the movie that was made by the same director.", "label": "System: That trilogy was really good. i think it took the director 10 plus years to make the sequel for <movie>. Honestly, I'm glad <movie> came out later because the technology they had back in the day did not do movies justice compared to now."}
{"pred": "System: I agree. I really enjoyed the movie. I also really liked the movie that was made in the same year.", "label": "System: YES!! To be honest though, I like more and more movies coming out don't have enough originality. So movie company rather throw in an explosion or two just to make the more captivating."}
{"pred": "System: I agree, I really like the action scenes and the story line that they have in the movie.", "label": "System: Sorry for my lack of words the last comment. I reread what I typed and it made no sense. Yes, action movies are great but almost all the actions movies that are released are comic book based or unoriginal. I have yet to see a movie that's not based on a book or a documentary of some kind."}
{"pred": "System: I don't think so. I think it's more of a thriller or a horror movie.", "label": "System: No, I don't know any films like that. I usually don't watch foreign films, mostly because of the subtitles. Although, all the films you've been recommending seem super interesting."}
{"pred": "System: What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. What is the latest movie you have watched?"}

{"pred": "System: Great!", "label": "System: I've seen the movie and I can definitely recommend seeing that and many of the other DC comics movies. Have you seen Batman vs Superman?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh, I'm not familiar with that one. What's it about?", "label": "System: What about Justice League?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. It's about a group of superheroes fighting against the evil evil evil villain.", "label": "System: Okay. If you watch <movie> vs Superman you get some good background on Batman, but you don't have to watch it to get <movie>. Justice League gives a good intro to the <movie> character, but again, you don't have to see it to enjoy Aquaman. I just think his parts in the movie are hilarious and give you a feel for the character."}
{"pred": "System: What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: Oh thats great, I do too! Have you seen To All The Boys I've Loved Before?"}
{"pred": "System: To All the Boys Ive Loved In My Life is a great movie. It's a very good movie.", "label": "System: The plot is basically a girls love letters shes written to her past loves are exposed. It sort of came out of nowhere and the sequel is coming out soon!"}

{"pred": "System: It's a comedy with a couple of young girls who are trying out for a job. It's about a young girl who is trying to find a job and she's not very good at it.", "label": "System: Well actually maybe thats not great, its more of a musical, how about The Office Mixup? A woman pretends to be a corporate executive after a case of mistaken identity at her workplace."}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: Ok,there is a movie called Isn't It Romantic with Rebel Wilson, Natalie is a New York architect who works hard to get noticed at her job, but is more likely to deliver coffee and bagels than design the city's next skyscraper.

{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it! I'm not a fan of the new movies though.", "label": "System: If you liked the first one, I would definitely recommend watching the new one. I think it was as good as the first and better than the second. Fast paced action and, of course, lots of explosions."}
{"pred": "System: I think the new movie is going to be a good one. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: I've enjoyed all the Marvel movies. Plus it's about time Scarlett Johansson got her own super hero movie. But since it is not due out for a couple of months would you be interested in watching a trailer for <movie>?"}

{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it. I hope it is a good movie.", "label": "System: Yes. You should watch the <movie> trailer. I don't really like super hero movies either, but it was unique because the character isn't a traditional super hero like we see in Spiderman. The movie also had social and historical elements, and is based on Africa. It is really unique and insightful. It isn't like a Captain America movie haha. That's why i'd recommend it."}

If you like so terrible its funny types of films, <movie> was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will love it! I think it's a little bit of a thriller. I think the plot is a little too predictable.", "label": "System: That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later.

{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the <movie> CGI was pretty well done.

{"pred": "System: I love the vampire ones, but I'm not sure about the vampire one. I'm going to watch the movie again soon!", "label": "System: I will say, I was a fan of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter as well. I didn't think I'd like it as I am, honestly, very reserved about gore in horror films and am not a fan. But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror film! I think you'll enjoy it. It's about a vampire who is a vampire and is a ghost.", "label": "System: Ah! Excellent. You'll be well prepared for your podcast up and coming ;) I also highly recommend <movie>. Halle Berry plays the main role, and the twist at the end is just absolutely stunning if you ask me.

I'm also pretty excited for the next Fantastic Beasts series. Have you checked out the kid who would be king?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you can find it on Netflix. I think it's on Netflix too.", "label": "System: right, i was going to say some other ones, but didn't send it. i think some more darker ones that are on netflix that i really enjoyed was <movie>. Have you seen that one?"}

It's by Guillermo del Toro so it has kind of that similar <movie>-esq creatures but I liked this a lot better than Hellboy"}
{"pred": "System: I haven't seen it but I've seen the first one. I think I'll watch the second one and I'm going to watch it again soon.", "label": "System: i haven't seen the new <movie>, but I probably will at some point =) So shall we go for the trailer of the new <movie> or <movie>?"}

{"pred": "System: I'm sorry for the delay. I'm not sure if I can help you with the other one.", "label": "System: sure i think i have to click the done button so i will in the next window"}

It takes place in the early 1900s. It looks like a mix of <movie> and Pirates of the Caribbean. A lot of action and adventure. Does that sound like something you would like to see?"}

{"pred": "System: It's about a group of people who are in a relationship with each other and they're trying to figure out what to do with their lives.", "label": "System: Not really animals, they are people that look like their emotions. I think there are some animals when they adventure through the brain."}
{"pred": "System: Children, adults, kids, kids.", "label": "System: The focus is on the young girl, but adults will certainly relate if they can remember being a kid.:)"}
{"pred": "System: It's a great film. It's about a young girl who is a little girl and she's a little boy and she has a little kid who is in her early twenties.", "label": "System: Have your snacks and drinks ready so you don't have to miss anything, and don't forget the tissues of you tend to cry....it might cause a few to fall!"}
{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: Awesome! Have a great night watching it. There is a cool Pixar Short for it as well, you can probably find it in the extras. Very cute scenario in the park with actors switching as the people change the emotions. I gotta go now, but I hope that you enjoy the flick!"}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like the movie <movie>. It is a very good movie.", "label": "System: Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s."}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it. I hope it is a good movie.", "label": "System: My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and The <movie> are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing."}

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: You are welcome"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. I hope you enjoy the movie.", "label": "System: Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy this movie. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: If you are ever curious what became of Oscar Wilde there is a 2018 movie, <movie> that explains what became of him. Subsequently, explaining why we haven't heard from him after a certain period of time."}
{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy <movie>. It's about a guy who is a little girl and is a very good person.", "label": "System: Yes...Oscar Wilde is an interesting character to learn about. Don't forget to have tea and pastries for your movie night. A good idea with a Victorian themed movie date. HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT....good night"}

On her wedding night she has to play a game of hide and seek. The rest of the family is trying to kill her, and she has to stay hidden until dawn to win.

The leading guy, who's adorable, probably isn't considered a big box office draw, like Brad Pitt. It seemed to be more of an independent little art-house type romantic comedy, if that makes sense. Now I want to re-watch it! Did the movie make you tear up?"}
{"pred": "System: I love John Lennon. I think he was the best part of the movie!", "label": "System: Ohhhh, yes. I just got chills! Shall I recommend another movie or do you feel comfortable with where we are in our conversation?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it! It's a great movie!", "label": "System: The one I'm talking about is the one from 2017, I do know there is the new one out I think it's called <movie>, I'll be going to see that as soon as I get the chance"}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: No problem, please enjoy it!"}

{"pred": "System: i like <movie>", "label": "System: you might like either Veep or Shameless if you don't watch either one already"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it.", "label": "System: yeah it's a bit of a roller coaster. you start off rooting for some characters and by the end of a season you do a complete 180"}

{"pred": "System: What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: so I see you are looking for a movie recommendation?"}
{"pred": "System: yes, I am looking for an action movie", "label": "System: Of Course! I go to the theatre alot and see most of what Hollywood puts out there. What type of movie do you think you might like? what genre if I may ask?.."}

{"pred": "System: It is a great movie! I am glad you enjoyed it!", "label": "System: Yes, the base of the movie is about two British privates that were given an impossible mission to deliver a message deep in enemy territory, these days they would just use phone or email."}
{"pred": "System: No, I don't think I will. I'm going to watch it again.", "label": "System: I don't have plans set in stone but I would like to watch it before it is no longer available in theater. I think war movies are best watched on a big screen with surround sound."}
{"pred": "System: That's awesome. I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: That's not a bad idea, a sound bar would be a great addition to a home theater system!"}

{"pred": "System: Yes, I do. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: I enjoy the true stories, I have my degree in criminal Justice so I enjoy learning about the cases and psychological aspect. As for horror in general, I'm more of a comedy person."}
{"pred": "System: The Last Train Home is a great movie. It's a great film that has a lot to offer.", "label": "System: That is a hard one. As a kid, hands down any <movie>. But, now there are so many good ones. I just don't care to much for the remakes.. like American pie was cool, not the 2,4, or 6th one"}
{"pred": "System: So you like the original movies?", "label": "System: I'm finding it difficult to decide on which one to recommend. I've narrowed it down to two"}
{"pred": "System: Great! I'm glad I could help you.", "label": "System: Well the first, Maggie, isn't based on a true story (as previously discussed) but given our current events with the coronavirus, who's to say it couldn't happen? Lol. It stars some phenomenal and well known actors as well."}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie, I think you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: However, I am leaning towards the movie trailer for <movie>. It has 8 awards and 19 nominations. The story line is sure to keep you in the edge of your seat."}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie! I'm glad you enjoyed it! I hope you enjoy the movie!", "label": "System: I've personally never seen the entire movie. However, I read this book called Sybil many times I loved it so much and the plot to split reminded me so much of the book. Sybil was based off a true story with multi personalities."}
{"pred": "System: What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: What kinds of movie trailers might you be interested in seeing?"}
{"pred": "System: I do. What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: I do, but I'm a big fan of horror movies. How about you?"}
{"pred": "System: Ok. I'm not too big on horror movies but I like the suspense. What is the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: What was the last horror movie or horror movie trailer that you watched?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh, I think you would like the movie <movie>", "label": "System: Horror movies are so much fun to watch. When you can remember which ones you watched, do you mind telling me what you liked or didn't like about the movie?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh, I really liked that one. I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: Annabelle, yes. I loved that movie! I totally recommend that you watch the Candyman trailer. Candyman is a movie about a black man who was murdered for being in love with a white woman. He is summoned to reality by a skeptic college graduate student who was infatuated with his story."}
{"pred": "System: That's a great movie. I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: There is a sequel coming out in June, yes. As I'm a big fan of the original 1992 movie, I think you would love it."}
{"pred": "System: I think it's a great movie. I think the movie is a little bit too long though.", "label": "System: The one coming out in June? Yes, it looks to be quite promising. The 1992 film was absolutely amazing. I was re-watching the movie for the one millionth time last year and during my re-watch, when Candyman was being summoned, the power went out in my house. Talk about jump scare! I thought he was coming to my home. :D I think anyone who hasn't seen this movie, should definitely give it a try. It's got a great story, great actors and is plenty creepy."}
{"pred": "System: I think I will check out the movie. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: Oh, definitely! Tony Todd, the actor who plays Candyman in the 1992 film and the upcoming one is the perfect actor for this character. He has this deep voice that will send chills down your spine when you hear him speak. I absolutely love it. Can't get enough of it."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, he is the main actor. He's the main character in the movie.", "label": "System: Somewhat, yes. Anthony McCoy is going to be a hallucinatory reflection of the Candyman. We will still hear Tony Todd's voice I believe and may even see him a few times in the 2020 film. Quite interesting. I have high hopes for the remake that's coming out later this year, but since we may not see Tony Todd much in the movie, I strongly recommend for you to see 1992 film."}
{"pred": "System: It is on Netflix. It's called <movie>. It is a great movie.", "label": "System: It is, yes! You can watch the movie on Netflix."}
{"pred": "System: What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: Can you tell me about what kinds of movie trailers you are interested in?"}
{"pred": "System: What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: Yes, that makes sense! What was the last movie you watched that you enjoyed?"}
{"pred": "System: I love Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse! I think I will watch that one soon!", "label": "System: Oh, nice! What was your favorite thing about the movie?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would really enjoy it. Have you seen the movie trailer?", "label": "System: That's a great observation. Have you seen the <movie> movies?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy it. I think the new one is a little bit better than the original.", "label": "System: And are you a fan of the rest of the Marvel Universe?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy it. It's a very good movie.", "label": "System: Well, there are so many movies out there, it's hard to make time for all of them."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy the new Avengers movies. They are very good.", "label": "System: I haven't seen all of them either, but I also have enjoyed the ones I've watched. Many of the movies have a dramatic appeal-- is that something you enjoy?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh, I'm a big fan of those. I'm also a big Star Wars fan.", "label": "System: Ooh, thrillers! I have to admit I am more the type to read the description on Wikipedia! Do you like being on the edge of your seat in a movie, or do you like everything to work out in the end?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh, I'm a big fan of that too. I'm also a big movie fan.", "label": "System: Okay! I personally enjoy movies with great cinematography, what about you?"}
{"pred": "System: Have you seen the movie The Last Samurai?", "label": "System: Have you seen The <movie>? If not, I would recommend it!"}
{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it! Have a great day!", "label": "System: I have also heard that Ant Man is a popular one."}

{"pred": "System: Oh yeah, I love that movie too. I think you will like it.", "label": "System: Same. Are you excited for the new Thor movie?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh yeah, I love Thor Ragnarok", "label": "System: Me too! I love that it went in a different direction than the others. More comedic. Kinda feel like rewatching it now that you mention it. Would you rewatch it?"}
{"pred": "System: It was great!", "label": "System: Nice, that's great!"}
{"pred": "System: Awesome! I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: Haha cool! Oh yeah, and also loved the trailer. Might be worth a rewatch too"}

{"pred": "System: Oh, I'm sorry I didn't realize you were watching the movie. I'm going to watch it now.", "label": "System: Oh I'm sorry. I'm not that familiar with <movie>. My son and husband enjoy them. Have you seen any <movie> yet?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a movie about a group of teenagers who are trying to save their parents from a bad situation. It's about a family that is trying to help them through their childhood adventure.", "label": "System: It's pretty funny. I watched it with my teenagers. It's about these three 12-year-old boys who get invited to their first kissing party. So they decide to do some research and spy on the teenage girls next door. You can only imagine how crazy and out of hand things go from there."}
{"pred": "System: I saw it on the theater, it was a great movie. I think you will like it.", "label": "System: You can rent it on Amazon Prime, Vudu or Apple. <movie> is at the theaters and I heard that is very funny. I have not had a chance to see it yet."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. It is a comedy with a lot of action and a little romance.", "label": "System: Yeah I think you are right about <movie>. Would you like me to link you to the trailers for those?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like <movie>. It's a very good movie.", "label": "System: Are you more a fan of cerebral comedies, slapstick, or something in between?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would really enjoy <movie>. It's a great movie about a group of people who are trying to find out who they are going to find in the next few days.", "label": "System: Are you a fan of crossing genres when it comes to comedy?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it. I'm not a fan either.", "label": "System: I have one just for you! Knives Out comedic take on a murder mystery scenario, with strong characters and a plot that will keep you guessing."}
{"pred": "System: Have a great day!", "label": "System: Great! I hope you will enjoy."}

{"pred": "System: I'm not really into horror movies. I like a lot of horror movies but I'm also a fan of the action movies.", "label": "System: I love horror, that's one of my top 3 genres. Comedy is pretty good too. Are you familiar with the Saw movies?"}
{"pred": "System: The first one was a little bit of a slog. The second one was really good.", "label": "System: Oh yes. The most disturbing one, for me, was Saw II, very graphic, very gory."}
{"pred": "System: It is a bit of both. I think it's a bit more of a thriller.", "label": "System: I would say more on the creative gore side. But you also mentioned that you liked Comedy. Do you have a favorite comedian?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it. I'm not a fan of zombie movies but I'm sure you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: Kinda hard not to like anything that Seth Rogen touches, that guy has a direct line to my funny bone. So, a fellow zombie fan as well...how about a combination of the two??"}

{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie!", "label": "System: I would. It's similar to A Quiet Place but different enough to be interesting so you dont feel like youre watching the same movie again. It's less focused on the quiet elements but features a good bit of mysterious fantasy creatures and a general sci-fi mystery plot"}
{"pred": "System: You're welcome.", "label": "System: You'll like it. But if I may make another suggestion. Don't Breathe is also great within this genre. This title would be more of a suspenseful, quiet, with lots of scares and a less involved plot."}

{"pred": "System: It came out in theaters last year.", "label": "System: It came out in 2019 in the summer."}
{"pred": "System: I liked it. It was a good movie.", "label": "System: So many good jokes. They are 2 highschool girls that realize they never had fun in high school so they cram it in to one night and go on this insane adventure filled with parties, being arrested, dancing, and each kissing people they have liked throughout high school. They are best friends that have such hilarious commentary."}

{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: I have a good feeling that you will enjoy it! It even gave me an adrenaline rush when I saw it."}

{"pred": "System: Great. I hope you enjoy the movie. I think you will enjoy the trailer.", "label": "System: They occasionally do. From what I remember about the Gemini Man trailer is that it only gives away plot points that are already evident on the movie cover. There are enough other twists hidden in the movie."}
{"pred": "System: That's a great movie. I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: This will in line with his normal level of acting. Throwing in suttle humor while not losing the mood of the scene."}
{"pred": "System: He is a great actor. He is also a great director.", "label": "System: I agree. It's fun to see long time actors also evolve into other roles. Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of BelAir to his movie roles now are night and day but it is still authentically him."}

{"pred": "System: I love that movie! I love the suspense and suspense that accompanies it.", "label": "System: I saw that too, extremely interesting. Would you want a movie with a similar story line, or perhaps something a little different?"}
{"pred": "System: That's a great movie! I think you'll be a fan of the original.", "label": "System: I see. I am not as much a fan of all silence as well, but I think it can be extraordinarily creepy if the sound is done right. I have a movie in mind that I was much a fan of. The gore is there, lighter but extreme when it does happen. I would suggest you try looking up The Transfiguration. It's a drama/horror flick and I found it to be moving."}
{"pred": "System: It's about a woman who is in a coma and she has to find out what she can do to save her life.", "label": "System: The Transfiguration is about a seemingly normal boy who believes he is a vampire. He is dark and withdrawn, and believes he is a monster. You get to follow him through a snapshot of his story, and all of it is very dark."}
{"pred": "System: It's about a guy who is a new born vampire and is trying to figure out what he does and what he can do to help him overcome his fears.", "label": "System: It came out in 2016 in the Cannes Film Festival from an Australian director. Haha, I had a Shudder account for a brief time and found it there while I was movie binging."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it was great. I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: It was well received and nominated for a few prizes but won nothing at Cannes. It did however win the General Jury prize at Dublin International in 2017."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a great film. It's a very good movie.", "label": "System: It's got 85% on Rotten Tomatoes! Only a 6/10 on IMDB but I think they were being a little hard on it for being an Indie film. It's almost slow moving in its thoughtfulness, but really pulled me in with its unique take on the theory of vampirism."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a very good movie. It is a very well made movie.", "label": "System: No, it's a film full of fresh meat! I actually sort of prefer horror movies this way, because you can go into it almost blind and you can really evaluate the talent or passion of the actors involved. I also love lesser known directors as I feel like they're willing to take shots other more well known directors might not take or just plain overdo. Do you look for more famous actors when you look for horror films?"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think you'll be fine. I'm not a fan of the movie itself but I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: I forgot to mention it's lightly romantic, but in a confusing (at least to me) way. Would you like to watch this movie trailer?"}
{"pred": "System: What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: What kind of movies do you prefer?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh nice! I love sci-flicks. What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: What was the latest movie you've watched?"}
{"pred": "System: I love Gladiator. What was your favorite part?", "label": "System: What did you like about it?"}
{"pred": "System: I agree. I love the cinematographer.", "label": "System: Would you like a movie recommendation closer to Gladiator? Perhaps directed by the same director?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would really like it.", "label": "System: Have you ever seen Hannibal?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a very action packed movie.", "label": "System: It's directed by Ridley Scott and it is very well done in my opinion. It's about a very well respected Baltimore forensic psychiatrist who is also a cannibalistic serial killer. Once caught for his crimes, he agrees to help the FBI find other serial killers"}
{"pred": "System: The director is a great actor. He is a big part of the production.", "label": "System: Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy it. It is a great movie.", "label": "System: I also definitely would watch Silence of the Lambs, it's a 1991 film starring Jodie Foster and it's part of the Hannibal series. It also has Anthony Hopkins in it as he plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter as well in this one. It's a very interesting set of films and will have you on the edge of your seat"}
{"pred": "System: No, I just wanted to recommend that you watch the movie.", "label": "System: No, I think that's it. Is there any questions for me?"}

{"pred": "System: i think you will like <movie>", "label": "System: haven't seen it yet"}
{"pred": "System: yes i have", "label": "System: not yet.. what about goofball comedies like Fifty Shades of Black"}
{"pred": "System: <movie> is a great movie. It's a great comedy with a great cast and great supporting cast.", "label": "System: yeah pretty funny"}
{"pred": "System: it's a great movie.", "label": "System: I like those over the top comedy movies like that. Scary Movie when the weed plant smokes smokey lol had me dying."}
{"pred": "System: oh wow, I remember you. I think you will like it.", "label": "System: even the og movies like naked gun as well haha"}
{"pred": "System: <movie> is a great movie. It's a great comedy with a great plot", "label": "System: Thank you for your time and recomendations"}
{"pred": "System: you too", "label": "System: take care"}
{"pred": "System: They are all action movies, but the action is a little different. The action is more of a story driven story.", "label": "System: I would say they are action with some satirical humor thrown in at times."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think it's a great movie. I think you'll like it.", "label": "System: I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie mementos"}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. I think you'll like it.", "label": "System: I remember I watched it for a college class I think it was political science and I really did fall in love with it. The end is truly one of a kind."}
{"pred": "System: You're welcome. I hope you enjoy it.", "label": "System: No problem at all, I'm glad I was able to help, it's difficult to find good movies sometimes it seems."}
{"pred": "System: Yeah I liked it. It was a great movie.", "label": "System: Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, Christopher Nolan directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it! I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: Thank you for the compliment, but I'm no expert I just happened to notice it was him and when you mentioned <movie> films I was like, Oh yeah I remember he directed that movie."}
{"pred": "System: I think the one with the Joker is a great one. I think it's a great movie. I'm going to watch it again now.", "label": "System: That's a tough one because it is a unique film, but going off of the genre you mentioned earlier, psychological drama, I think Identity is another good one where the main guy has schizophrenia and his personalities end up killing each other within his own head. It's quite a brain twister."}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it. It is a great movie. I think it's a great film.", "label": "System: Yes that one is also excellent, a classic Russell Crowe movie."}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it. It is a great movie. I think it's a great film.", "label": "System: Another one sort of like those I argue is part of that drama is Phonebooth, although there is a lot of action in it, and possibly more thriller than drama, but I think it's so brilliantly done that I definitely would mention that too when it comes to psychological drama type of movies, definitely my favorite Collin Farrell movie of all time."}
{"pred": "System: I agree, I think that's a great movie. I think you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: One movie that I didn't realize was designed to make a political statement until I watched a behind the scenes on it recently was Dawn of the Dead, the originial 1975 version. Romero described that the whole consumerism thing was his inspiration, where the mall shoppers are like zombies. A classic, and when you think about it, you can see that in the film."}
{"pred": "System: I'm looking for a movie recommendation.", "label": "System: Let me find out a little more about you first. What do you like to typically watch?"}
{"pred": "System: I love action movies! What is your favorite action movie?", "label": "System: Ok, that's a broad range! Let's narrow down a little further. What are you in the mood for right now?"}
{"pred": "System: I think that's what I'd like to see. I'm not sure if I've seen it yet.", "label": "System: That's the vampire movie, right? Do you want to stick with lighthearted vampire fun, or just cheesy fantasy in general?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you'd really like that one. I think it's a little bit of a comedy.", "label": "System: Have you seen <movie> yet?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you'd enjoy it. It's a little bit of a slow start but it's a great time to watch.", "label": "System: It's directed by Tika Waititi and is a comedy set in Nazi era Germany."}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: I think you'll really like it. It got a 7.1 on IMDB and 80% on Rotten Tomatoes."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it is funny.", "label": "System: It's a mix of really funny and a little tragic. But I guess it's hard not to have a little tragedy when you're talking about WW2 and Hitler. How do you feel about Scarlett Johansson?"}
{"pred": "System: That's a great movie. I'm glad you liked it.", "label": "System: Taika Waititi plays Hitler, too."}
{"pred": "System: He's also in the new <movie>.", "label": "System: Would you like to see the trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: I've never seen either of those but I like sci-flicks. What was the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: That's great, do you prefer stuff that's realistic or do you prefer stuff that's out there?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would really like the movie <movie>. It's a very action packed movie.", "label": "System: Gotta watch stuff that's out there sometimes, but realistic is good too."}
{"pred": "System: I agree. I'm not a fan of the action movies either.", "label": "System: So I imagine a sci-fi military movie would be great for you."}
{"pred": "System: I think you would really enjoy it.", "label": "System: Any particular director's you're fond of?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like the movie <movie>", "label": "System: Have you seen <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: I thought it was pretty good. Maybe not for everyone but should be satisfying if you're into futuristic takes on military ethics."}
{"pred": "System: Awesome, I hope you enjoy it.", "label": "System: Cool, it's got Harrison Ford in it and it's based on a good book."}

{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Richard Kind are among the cast"}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it!", "label": "System: I really like the movie, very easy to relate. Definitely gives you that warm feeling afterward."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it is.", "label": "System: Yes, it is."}
{"pred": "System: They are not, but they are very interesting characters.", "label": "System: I would say so. In my opinion, Inside out shows children that it is normal to have crazy mixture of emotion during stressful times. The key is to have good communication with people you trust. Coco shows the importance of family and tradition."}
{"pred": "System: It was released in 2015, so it was released last year.", "label": "System: I agree. It was released in 2015"}
{"pred": "System: No, it's not on Netflix.", "label": "System: <movie> is not on Netflix, but you can find it on Youtube, GooglePlay, and Amazon Prime for $3, same for Coco"}
