{"pred": "System: The health ledger led to the death of the Joker.", "label": "System: The most recent movie. It's just called '<movie>'. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend."}
{"pred": "System: They are not really about the characters but rather the characters. They are more about the character's character development.", "label": "System: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything."}
{"pred": "System: I would say that it is more like a comic book with a little bit of a twist.", "label": "System: <movie> was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real."}

{"pred": "System: Well I think you'll be fine. I'm not a fan of the movie but I'm sure you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: Hmm well as for some solid gems on Netflix, check out Tau and Ex Machina they're both sifi but on the dark side. Also as far Joaquin Phoenix goes the movie 'Her' is fantastic and will make you cry. lol"}

{"pred": "System: Oldboy is a great one. I think it's a little bit of a thriller.", "label": "System: It has a much more gothic aesthetic and it has a bit less action than oldboy but I would say it's just as good in its own way"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a very good movie.", "label": "System: It's a little underwhelming actually. Have you seen <movie> thou? The music is really good on that one and the tone is very similar to Sympathy for Mr Vengeance"}

{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it!", "label": "System: Got it! I recommend <movie>. You seem to like somewhat older/more classic movies. Love Actually is fast paced, as it has multiple plot lines moving at once. There are several plot lines that I find hilarious to break up the more mushy plot lines. It also has a great cast, with actors like Colin Firth and Bill Nighy. How does that sound?"}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it!", "label": "System: Yes, he's great in this movie! My favorite part of the movie is the washed up pop star who keeps forgetting the lyrics to his own songs haha. And two porn stars who fall in love!
