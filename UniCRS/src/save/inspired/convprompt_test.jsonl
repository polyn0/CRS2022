{"pred": "System: Yes, I love it!", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}
{"pred": "System: I'm not sure if I can recommend a movie for you, but I'm sure you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: Thank you! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you will like it.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes. Other than that Avengers: infinity wars has many characters but ultimatley has a good romantic plot as well. i suggest both for sure. I'll recommend <movie> trailer though."}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like it.", "label": "System: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and <movie>."}
{"pred": "System: I think you would like it.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: It's a comedy with a little romance. It's about a man who is a little man and a little girl.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved."}

Every person has an implant that records their every move, and their life and records can be accessed anytime through The Ether. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on it"}

{"pred": "System: it does. <movie> is a great movie.", "label": "System: last year actually"}
{"pred": "System: it was a great movie.", "label": "System: thats really a debate. some people didnt like it, but i think they where not bog fans of the franchise before hand, but fans of the franchise loved it."}
{"pred": "System: yeah he was in the movie and he was great in it. he was also in the new Terminator and Terminator movies.", "label": "System: i dont think so.. well i have to log off now. is there anything else i can answer for you or help you with?"}

{"pred": "System: I'm going to recommend a movie called The Last Man, I'll recommend a new movie called, The Last Place.", "label": "System: Absolutely. Can you give me some examples of movies you watched and enjoyed?"}
{"pred": "System: I love movies that are about the past. I also like movies that don't have a lot to do.", "label": "System: Great movie! Are you more interested in newer movies, or no preference?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would like Ex Machina", "label": "System: Do you like movies with a lot of action in them, or one that are more focused on the story and build up of events?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would like this movie. It's about a group of people who are trying to find out who they are going to find their best friend in the future.", "label": "System: I think I have the perfect movie for you. Do you enjoy a movie that you want to re-watch after its over because the ending was so unexpected?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a very action packed movie. It's about a man who is in a coma and has to find a new job.", "label": "System: I recommend the 2013 movie Coherence directed by James Ward Byrkit."}
{"pred": "System: It's about a group of people who are trying to find out who they are going to find their next victim.", "label": "System: Its about a group of friends having a dinner party on the night of a comet passing over Earth.

{"pred": "System: It is!", "label": "System: Yes. I've seen it myself and really enjoyed it."}

{"pred": "System: I love horror movies. I am a big fan of horror movies and I really like the horror movies that are about to come out.", "label": "System: Have you heard of the boy 2"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would like the movie <movie>. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: Oh what did you like about it? I think you will like this one if you liked the last."}
{"pred": "System: Yes it is. It is a very good movie.", "label": "System: yes William Brent Bell was the director from the first as well."}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it. I hope you enjoy the trailer.", "label": "System: No problem!"}
{"pred": "System: I think ive seen the new <movie>, <movie> and <movie>. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: how about scary movie"}
{"pred": "System: I think it's coming out in 2019.", "label": "System: I think they're done making them"}
{"pred": "System: The new one is a good one.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie about a man who is a doctor and he's a doctor.", "label": "System: its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal."}
{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. I'm sure you'll like it.", "label": "System: Good glad you like the recommendation."}
{"pred": "System: You're welcome.", "label": "System: you're welcome, enjoy your movie friend."}
{"pred": "System: I like to watch movies. What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: For sure! What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw?"}
{"pred": "System: I love Knives out. It was a great movie. I think you'll like it.", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: Yeah, I'm not a fan of the new Star Wars movies. I think the new ones are a little bit better.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: They're all great, but the other one is a little bit of a different story. I think the other is the one about the guy who's a cop and the other guy is a cop.", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think it's one of the best Tarantino films.", "label": "System: It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
