{"pred": "System: <movie> is another good one.", "label": "System: My favorite genre is horror, do you have any suggestions for me?"}
{"pred": "System: <movie> is a good one too", "label": "System: I saw that, I thought it was an excellent use of silence in a horror film, especially for a first time director"}
{"pred": "System: It was a good movie.", "label": "System: Yes, representation is important Have you seen any good comedies lately?"}
{"pred": "System: <movie> is a good one too", "label": "System: <movie> was hilarious, I would definitely recommend it"}

{"pred": "System: I am great! What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: Doing fine, and you?"}
{"pred": "System: I am good. What kind of movie do you want to watch?", "label": "System: I tend to like things that are visually distinctive with multiple layers to work with. I lean towards animation most of the time because of its expressiveness. A good example would be the bleakness of <movie>, an animated documentary that just throws away objectivity and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its participants. What do you tend to like in films?"}
{"pred": "System: <movie> is a good one.", "label": "System: Have you seen any of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy ( <movie>, <movie>, <movie> )? They're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind <movie>. They're quite British, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series. (they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline you'd almost forget)"}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy them! Have a great day!", "label": "System: Any other films you like in particular?"}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend <movie>", "label": "System: In that case, I can just recommend the aforementioned <movie>, a fun and tightly-choreographed action film packed with wit, a heist film where almost everything is in sync with the music."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it is.", "label": "System: I'm not sure, but I can check not at this point, unfortunately"}
{"pred": "System: It's a great film.", "label": "System: To top things off (and fulfill my requirements), there's an anime film from a highly-regarded director that inspired many elements of <movie>, <movie> by Satoshi Kon. It's not to everyone's taste, but it might be worth a go if you want that kind of surreal head trip. Unfortunately, I'm running low on time, so I'll have to stop there. I hope that at least some of these are appealing and that you find at least one enjoyable. Have a good evening."}
{"pred": "System: <movie> is a good one", "label": "System: Me too! I am a big fan of <movie>"}
{"pred": "System: <movie> is a good one too.", "label": "System: It's a classic"}
