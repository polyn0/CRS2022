Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend."}
{"pred": "System: I'm a big movie guy.", "label": "System: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything."}
{"pred": "System: I would say that's a better recommendation.", "label": "System: <movie> was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real."}
{"pred": "System: I am not a religious person.", "label": "System: I don't remember any direct talk of any religion really. But i am biased i'm pretty agnostic so i dont watch for it much. I'd be more worried about becoming anarchist after watching it then any religious aspect."}

{"pred": "System: The Handmaid's Tale", "label": "System: It has a much more gothic aesthetic and it has a bit less action than oldboy but I would say it's just as good in its own way"}
{"pred": "System: What was the other movie that was directed by him?", "label": "System: It's a little underwhelming actually. Have you seen <movie> thou? The music is really good on that one and the tone is very similar to Sympathy for Mr Vengeance"}
{"pred": "System: I think they are both great movies.", "label": "System: I'd say <movie> is a bit better, the cinematography is really beautiful. It's a bit less action focused than <movie> but just as good!"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a good movie.", "label": "System: oh yes, it's a separate origin story that deals exclusively with the joker"}

{"pred": "System: That's a great movie.", "label": "System: Of course! It is a romantic comedy-drama. The film stars Queen Latifah as Georgia, a humble store assistant who is told that she has a rare brain condition and only has a few weeks to live. She promptly decides to spend her last funds on a luxury holiday in Europe (like a last hurrah) and she falls in love too!"}

{"pred": "System: I like your movies.", "label": "System: oh that seems interesting. Do you think that you would watch the movie <movie>? I think once you watch the trailer you will immediately put it on if you have time to watch a movie."}

{"pred": "System: I'm not a big fan of Stallman.", "label": "System: So I got two awesome choices you can tell me, which you prefer to hear more about. His awesome 80s hit <movie> or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated."}
{"pred": "System: I'm not a big fan of the genre, but I'm a huge fan of horror movies.", "label": "System: The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it. I forgot to mention his other hit <movie>! Its such a great 80s film demonstrating his cheesy yet entertaining acting. Set in the future as a regular working guy, he decides to enter a virtual world type place where he lives a fantasy life of a secret agent. Things go haywire in the process that lead to a crazy action adventure on Mars."}

{"pred": "System: I am not a fan. I have seen the book and I have watched the movie and watched the film.", "label": "System: It is of course based on the 1925 Novel written by F.Scott Fitsgerald. The original film version was lost but the movie has been redone several times and as recent as 2013 staring Leonardo Dicaprio. I would defiantly check it out."}
{"pred": "System: I think that's the one that was the best looking movie of the last few years, but I think it was a great one.", "label": "System: Yes, A writer and wall street trader finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor, Jay Gatsby.

{"pred": "System: Yes, I love that movie.", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}
{"pred": "System: I'm a huge fan of horror movies.", "label": "System: Thank you! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: I like superhero films.", "label": "System: Suicide squad from 2016 is pretty good and involves a romantic plotline, If you haven't seen The Amazing Spiderman i also suggest that. I most recentyly watched Spiderman: Into the Spider verse"}
{"pred": "System: I have seen that one too.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes. Other than that Avengers: infinity wars has many characters but ultimatley has a good romantic plot as well. i suggest both for sure. I'll recommend <movie> trailer though."}

{"pred": "System: I'm looking for a comedy.", "label": "System: Is there an actor or actress in particular that you know she likes?"}
{"pred": "System: I think she likes him more than me.", "label": "System: Alright, let me see what I can find!"}
{"pred": "System: I'm not sure if I'll be able to watch it.", "label": "System: How do you feel about <movie>? It's a mix of goofy comedy and action with the likes of Kevin Heart, Jack Black, and Dwayne Johnson."}
{"pred": "System: I'm not a big fan of his movies.", "label": "System: Yup, I think he dropped the moniker awhile back when he got serious about acting."}
{"pred": "System: I'd like to see it again.", "label": "System: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and <movie>."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I would recommend the movie that you should watch.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: I'm not a big fan of the classics.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved."}
{"pred": "System: I'm sure you'll enjoy it! I'm looking forward to watching it! Thanks for the recommendation!", "label": "System: Great, I really hope you two enjoy whatever you decide to see! I'll send the trailer for <movie> straight away, bye and take care."}

{"pred": "System: yes, I have seen it but I have not seen it yet.", "label": "System: He is in it! I thought he did a great job. By that I mean that he blended right in. You wouldn't have known that he wasn't previously a professional actor."}
{"pred": "System: Yes I do enjoy his movies.", "label": "System: It's one of the most unique war movies I've seen in a long long time."}
{"pred": "System: I will watch it again.", "label": "System: So would you like to watch the trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: Do you have any recommendations for movies that are good?", "label": "System: What was the latest movie that you've seen?"}
{"pred": "System: Have you seen the movie that was made by the same director as well?", "label": "System: That's an interesting title. Scarlett Johannsen is a great actress! What did you like about the movie? Anything you didn't care for?"}
{"pred": "System: Well, I'm not a fan of the movie.", "label": "System: Realistic movies feel easier to relate to. Do you enjoy watching romantic/serious movies or romantic/comedies?"}
{"pred": "System: Romance, Romance, Romantic, Romance and Romance.", "label": "System: I would recommend <movie> starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. This movie is both relate-able and fun to watch. It explores how children can feel or behave in a single parent household and also single parents looking for love.

I unfortunatley cant think of anything with Robert Downy Jr or Amber Heard. Thats not a comic book movie. Have you heard of Valerian and the City of a Thousdand Planets. Its preety cool! IF you like the 5th element you might like this. Its about aliens and shapeshifting. It has Cara Delevingne in it."}

{"pred": "System: I like the new one.", "label": "System: You will not regret it! it has the return of the original Sarah Conner ( well the lady who played her in the very first movie, Linda Hamilton i believe is her name), as well as Arnold as the terminator that has aged thru time who has stayed to make sure things stay on track for the human race and sky net never rises. plus the new terminators are awesome!!! the graphics and effects are next level for sure"}
{"pred": "System: I think she is the best actress in the movie.", "label": "System: yes he is, i didnt wanna spoil it!!"}
{"pred": "System: I think they are a little bit different from the original", "label": "System: well the t1000 is a endo skeletal machine system with living organic tissue. basically he gets older looking but his nucular battery keeps him going. they addressed this in the last movie <movie>"}
{"pred": "System: i think it's on Netflix.", "label": "System: vudu, hulu, redbox, youtube tv, etc"}
{"pred": "System: I do not have cable.", "label": "System: both really you can find it thru vudu and redbox for like 3.99 those are pay to play, but hulu is a service where you pay monthly amount and stream all you want,."}

{"pred": "System: I like, I like the first movie.", "label": "System: yes William Brent Bell was the director from the first as well."}
{"pred": "System: I like the first trailer.", "label": "System: No problem!"}
{"pred": "System: I have seen the trailer for the movie that was released last year, I think it was called The Boy 2", "label": "System: how about scary movie"}
{"pred": "System: Yes! I think they are", "label": "System: I think they're done making them"}
{"pred": "System: Yes I have seen the second one, I'm not a big horror person.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie.", "label": "System: its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal."}
{"pred": "System: oh, i think i'll watch it soon.", "label": "System: Good glad you like the recommendation."}
{"pred": "System: thank you for the recommendation!", "label": "System: you're welcome, enjoy your movie friend."}
{"pred": "System: I think you might like it.", "label": "System: For sure! What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you might enjoy that.", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: They are all so good.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: The other one that was good was The Last Crusade.", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I think you're right.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: It's a comedy.", "label": "System: It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
{"pred": "System: I'd like to see a movie about a movie that's about a guy who's trying to make a movie.", "label": "System: Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though."}
{"pred": "System: I am not a fan. I am a huge fan of the movie.", "label": "System: I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like."}
{"pred": "System: What is the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: You're very welcome. Glad to meet you! Hopefully you enjoy Once Upon a Time as much as I did!"}

{"pred": "System: I like the new trailer.", "label": "System: ok, here's my favorite favorite movie that I've seen recently - Bad Boys 3"}
{"pred": "System: I like it too. I like the movie.", "label": "System: it is great, not only a lot of action but really funny too!"}
{"pred": "System: I think it is a great movie.", "label": "System: In my opinion, it's the second funniest after the original movie."}
{"pred": "System: I like the first one, but I'm not a big movie. I like to see what you like about it.", "label": "System: I'm not as big a fan of comic book movies, but i've heard bloodshot is supposed to be really good."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it is", "label": "System: yup, that's the one"}

{"pred": "System: I will try to watch it soon.", "label": "System: It's a fun distraction. But it does seem to be never ending..."}
{"pred": "System: What is the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: Any older movies in particular? How old?"}
{"pred": "System: I love that movie. I have seen it many times.", "label": "System: I like Robert De Niro, I saw that he has a movie coming out on Netflix called <movie>. <movie> to watch it."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a movie about a man who is in a relationship with a woman who is married to a woman.", "label": "System: Yes it is. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro have made a lot of movies together, nine I think."}
{"pred": "System: It is a crime drama.", "label": "System: I believe so, it's described as an epic crime film"}
{"pred": "System: No, it hasn't been released yet.", "label": "System: It was released on November 1, 2019."}
{"pred": "System: The film is called The Last Man. It's a comedy about a man who is in the middle of a war and his life is a war with the mafia.", "label": "System: <movie> was directed by Edward Norton. Starring Bruce Willis"}
{"pred": "System: No, it was a different actor.", "label": "System: One critic said it requires a lot of patience to watch, but it has strong performances, and an interesting perspective. Most of the critics say it's an average movie."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it was a great movie. It was a very good movie. I think it's a great film.", "label": "System: The ratings are pretty high, most people giving it around eight out of ten stars. One person called it an epic gangster drama. Sounds kind of typical for a Scorsese film"}
{"pred": "System: I will be watching it soon.", "label": "System: Great, I hope you enjoy it."}
{"pred": "System: I love the movie that is about a man who is a little bit like a little girl and his family is a bit like his family.", "label": "System: That's great! Me too! So tell what is something you watched recently and loved?"}

{"pred": "System: The one that was released in 2013 is called The Dark Knight Returns.", "label": "System: The most recent movie. It's just called '<movie>'. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend."}
{"pred": "System: They are the same. They are not the same but they are both good but the plot is different.", "label": "System: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything."}
{"pred": "System: I would say that would be a better choice.", "label": "System: <movie> was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I would recommend it.", "label": "System: I don't remember any direct talk of any religion really. But i am biased i'm pretty agnostic so i dont watch for it much. I'd be more worried about becoming anarchist after watching it then any religious aspect."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I love John Wicker, I think he is a great actor.", "label": "System: Hmm well as for some solid gems on Netflix, check out Tau and Ex Machina they're both sifi but on the dark side. Also as far Joaquin Phoenix goes the movie 'Her' is fantastic and will make you cry. lol"}

{"pred": "System: The Handmaid's Tale is a great movie. It's a great film.", "label": "System: It has a much more gothic aesthetic and it has a bit less action than oldboy but I would say it's just as good in its own way"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I have seen it.", "label": "System: It's a little underwhelming actually. Have you seen <movie> thou? The music is really good on that one and the tone is very similar to Sympathy for Mr Vengeance"}
{"pred": "System: I think I will watch them both. I think the Joker is the best one.", "label": "System: I'd say <movie> is a bit better, the cinematography is really beautiful. It's a bit less action focused than <movie> but just as good!"}

{"pred": "System: Yes, it is a new story and a little bit of a different story but it is very good.", "label": "System: I'd say <movie> is better. Handmaiden is a bit slower and it's difficult not to compare it to <movie>."}

{"pred": "System: Yes, it is!", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}

{"pred": "System: I have seen that one. I have not seen the other one.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes. Other than that Avengers: infinity wars has many characters but ultimatley has a good romantic plot as well. i suggest both for sure. I'll recommend <movie> trailer though."}
{"pred": "System: It is about a guy who is in a coma and has to find his way home.", "label": "System: Suicide squad is about 2 hours and 17 minutes"}

{"pred": "System: I think I will check it out.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht.

{"pred": "System: Yes they are.", "label": "System: I think they're done making them"}
{"pred": "System: Yes I have seen all the new ones.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's about a guy who's a doctor and a doctor who's in the military and he's a cop and he has to help out a family.", "label": "System: its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal."}

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. I think I will enjoy the movie.", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: The Last Starfighter is a great movie. It's a great film.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: The other one is called The Last Starfighter. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I think I will watch that one. I will check out the trailer for the trailer.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a great movie.", "label": "System: It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
{"pred": "System: I think I will check it out. I will watch it.", "label": "System: Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though."}
{"pred": "System: I think I will watch it again. I will see if I can find it again, but I don't have time to watch it.", "label": "System: I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I'm looking for something that is a little bit more serious.", "label": "System: You're very welcome. Glad to meet you! Hopefully you enjoy Once Upon a Time as much as I did!"}

{"pred": "System: I think it is a great movie.", "label": "System: In my opinion, it's the second funniest after the original movie."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: I'm not as big a fan of comic book movies, but i've heard bloodshot is supposed to be really good."}
{"pred": "System: yes it is", "label": "System: yup, that's the one"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I accept it.", "label": "System: ok cool...do you think you'd prefer bad boys or bloodshot?"}
{"pred": "System: What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: What kind of movies do you like?"}

{"pred": "System: It's great! I hope you enjoy it! I think I will watch it soon!", "label": "System: Great I hope you like it!"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I do. I like the movie that is based on the book The Meyerowensons book, I think it's called The Meyerwitzens book.", "label": "System: That movie stars Adam Sandler in a somewhat dramatic role, so I'd recommend another one of his more serious movies as well, like <movie> or Punch-Drunk Love"}
{"pred": "System: I think I will watch them all.", "label": "System: Great! I think most of them are on Netflix as well!"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. I hope I can find a movie you like.", "label": "System: 50 First Dates is another I'd recommend"}
{"pred": "System: I do.

{"pred": "System: I have not. I have seen it.", "label": "System: In 1862 headstrong scientist James Glaisher and wealthy young widow Amelia Wren mount a balloon expedition to fly higher than anyone in history.

{"pred": "System: The one that is about the healthiest and most interesting part of the movie is the fact that the Joker is a psychopath.", "label": "System: The most recent movie. It's just called '<movie>'. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend."}
{"pred": "System: They are the same as the other movies.", "label": "System: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything."}

It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real."}

It also has a great cast, with actors like Colin Firth and Bill Nighy. How does that sound?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like the movie The Last Man on Earth. It's a comedy that is based on a true story.", "label": "System: I feel you on the handsome characters!! For a good Rom Com I enjoyed the movie Valentines Day. For something up lifting my favorite movie is Last Holiday with Queen Latifah."}
{"pred": "System: <movie> is a great movie. It's a classic!", "label": "System: Of course! It is a romantic comedy-drama. The film stars Queen Latifah as Georgia, a humble store assistant who is told that she has a rare brain condition and only has a few weeks to live. She promptly decides to spend her last funds on a luxury holiday in Europe (like a last hurrah) and she falls in love too!"}

{"pred": "System: She does have a family. She is a very happy person.", "label": "System: It is not a business trip it is a trip she takes to go live her life and do all these things on her bucket list after she finds out about all the bad news (but i promise you it is a happy ending) she has 1-2 friends and her family isn't in the story line really."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, she does. She is a very happy person.", "label": "System: He goes there with a purpose to deliver her certain news and I do not want to spoil the ending haha!"}

{"pred": "System: Jackie is a great actor.", "label": "System: Yes I like <movie>. Great Movie. Would you be interested in watching <movie> with Will Ferrel? Its hilarious."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it.", "label": "System: It is extremely funny. The whole movie from start to end. It has a story about two guys forced to live together because their parents marry each other. The funny thing is they still live at home and are grown men."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy the movie.", "label": "System: oh that seems interesting. Do you think that you would watch the movie <movie>? I think once you watch the trailer you will immediately put it on if you have time to watch a movie."}

{"pred": "System: i like the <movie> and <movie>.", "label": "System: I am a big fan of horror movies or dramas."}

His work in movies so serious, such as Captain Philips, and animated children's films, such as the <movie> movie, shows how versatile he can be."}
{"pred": "System: He is a great actor. He is also a great comedic actor.", "label": "System: Some of my favorites are the Toy Story movies, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, and Cast Away. Have you seen all of those?"}
{"pred": "System: It's about a guy who's a great actor and a great director.", "label": "System: Yes! Part of the movie does include his work with the shrimp company, known as Bubba Gump Shrimp. Would you like me to explain a little more about it to see if you would be interested?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a comedy with a lot of action, but it's a little bit of a comedy.", "label": "System: It has a little bit of both! Happy and funny moments but also some very serious and sad. I feel like this movie would really appeal to you!"}
{"pred": "System: The plot is a little like a movie about a guy who is a cop and his life is a mystery.", "label": "System: The movie is all about the life of our protagonist, Forrest Gump. It begins with him as a boy growing up in Alabama. Throughout the movie, you witness his incredible journey of success. I will not spoil it, but much of the story includes love, the Vietnam War, and fame. I really think you would love this movie!"}
{"pred": "System: Yes! It's a very dark and serious story.", "label": "System: The movie begins with Forrest as a boy during the 1950's then takes you throughout his life until about 1980. There are aspects of racism within the film that do coincide with some of the negative views that took place during those times. The film absolutely does not agree with any of the negative views that some characters exemplify."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy this movie. It is a very good movie.", "label": "System: Oh my sounds like a good night! Maybe I will re-watch it with a bottle of cabernet sauvignon. Quarantine life has been tough, but movies are keeping me going. The movie will definitely give you some motivation to get through the tough times."}
{"pred": "System: I think he is. He is a great actor and a great character.", "label": "System: It used to be on Netflix, although they took it off. I am sure you can find it online somewhere for a small fee!"}

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy the first one, it's a great movie.", "label": "System: The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it.

{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. It's not a great one but it's still a great film.", "label": "System: You know what, me either! But the movie captures Batman's humor perfectly. - He's forced to drop is lone vigilante persona and join force with other superheros to beat the <movie> from taking over Gotham."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it is!", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}
{"pred": "System: I think I'll watch it. It's a little bit of a comedy but it's still a great movie.", "label": "System: Thank you! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: I do too. I like the superhero movies that are based on the superhero genre.", "label": "System: Suicide squad from 2016 is pretty good and involves a romantic plotline, If you haven't seen The Amazing Spiderman i also suggest that. I most recentyly watched Spiderman: Into the Spider verse"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes. Other than that Avengers: infinity wars has many characters but ultimatley has a good romantic plot as well. i suggest both for sure. I'll recommend <movie> trailer though."}

{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy the movie The Last Man, with Kevin Hart.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: I'm not sure if I can find it on Netflix. I'll have to check it out.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved."}

{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy it. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: The first one was a little bit of a comedy but I really enjoyed the second one.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: <movie>, I think is a good one. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy the movie. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it's a great movie. It's a very good one.", "label": "System: It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
{"pred": "System: I think you would like the trailer for The Haunting, which is a horror movie. It's a horror film with a lot of action, but it's not a horror.", "label": "System: Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. It is a great movie.", "label": "System: I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like."}

{"pred": "System: <movie> is a great movie. It's a great one.", "label": "System: I'm not as big a fan of comic book movies, but i've heard bloodshot is supposed to be really good."}
{"pred": "System: yes it is", "label": "System: yup, that's the one"}

{"pred": "System: It's about a family that's in a relationship with a family.", "label": "System: That movie stars Adam Sandler in a somewhat dramatic role, so I'd recommend another one of his more serious movies as well, like <movie> or Punch-Drunk Love"}

{"pred": "System: The first one with health ledger", "label": "System: The most recent movie. It's just called '<movie>'.

Highly recommend."}
{"pred": "System: They are the same as the movie.", "label": "System: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything."}

Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real."}

{"pred": "System: It's a movie about a man who is a good guy and a good boy. It is a great movie.", "label": "System: Well you'll definitely have to catch up on the other 2. It's about two cops in Miami who are best friends. Ones a more tied down family man and the other is a big time playboy who like to live the lavish life.

His awesome 80s hit <movie> or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it. I forgot to mention his other hit <movie>! Its such a great 80s film demonstrating his cheesy yet entertaining acting. Set in the future as a regular working guy, he decides to enter a virtual world type place where he lives a fantasy life of a secret agent. Things go haywire in the process that lead to a crazy action adventure on Mars."}

{"pred": "System: Yes, I love it! It's a great movie.", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy the movie", "label": "System: Suicide squad from 2016 is pretty good and involves a romantic plotline, If you haven't seen The Amazing Spiderman i also suggest that. I most recentyly watched Spiderman: Into the Spider verse"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes.

{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy it.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: It's a comedy with a great cast and a great director.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved."}

{"pred": "System: Yes they are.", "label": "System: I think they're done making them"}
{"pred": "System: Yes I think so.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: Yeah, I'm not a fan of the new Star Wars movies. I think they're all just a bit too much.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: <movie>, <movie> and <movie> are the ones I've seen, but haven't seen the others. I think I'll check out the other ones.", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy this movie. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think it is! I think the movie is a little bit of a classic, but it's still a classic nonetheless.", "label": "System: It was fantastic.

Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend."}
{"pred": "System: They are all about the same. I would recommend the movie <movie>. It is a great movie.", "label": "System: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him.

{"pred": "System: I think that would be a good choice. I think the movie is a little more interesting than the movie.", "label": "System: <movie> was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them.

{"pred": "System: I think you would like it. It's a classic!", "label": "System: It is of course based on the 1925 Novel written by F.Scott Fitsgerald. The original film version was lost but the movie has been redone several times and as recent as 2013 staring Leonardo Dicaprio. I would defiantly check it out."}

{"pred": "System: Yes, I think so. I think it's one of my favorites.", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like the movie <movie>", "label": "System: Do you enjoy superhero movies? I can suggest a few that fit your preference"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like the movie <movie>", "label": "System: Suicide squad from 2016 is pretty good and involves a romantic plotline, If you haven't seen The Amazing Spiderman i also suggest that. I most recentyly watched Spiderman: Into the Spider verse"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes. Other than that Avengers: infinity wars has many characters but ultimatley has a good romantic plot as well. i suggest both for sure. I'll recommend <movie> trailer though."}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like to see a movie with a similar story to Star Wars, I think it would be a good recommendation.", "label": "System: Haha, ok. Are you looking for more of a general comedy film or something perhaps more romantic?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like it.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it. I hope you enjoy the movie.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved."}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it! I hope it is a good one.", "label": "System: Great, I really hope you two enjoy whatever you decide to see! I'll send the trailer for <movie> straight away, bye and take care."}

{"pred": "System: no, it was released in 2015, it came out in 2016, it's a new movie", "label": "System: last year actually"}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like Ex Machina", "label": "System: Great movie! Are you more interested in newer movies, or no preference?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would like to see the trailer for <movie>. It's a great movie with great plot and a great cast.", "label": "System: Do you like movies with a lot of action in them, or one that are more focused on the story and build up of events?"}

{"pred": "System: It's about a man who is a man with a very good job and a very high IQ. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: Its about a group of friends having a dinner party on the night of a comet passing over Earth.

{"pred": "System: I think you would like the trailer for the new movie The Boy With No Name", "label": "System: Oh what did you like about it? I think you will like this one if you liked the last."}
{"pred": "System: Yes it is. I think it is a great movie.", "label": "System: yes William Brent Bell was the director from the first as well."}

{"pred": "System: I think the new <movie> movie is coming out soon.", "label": "System: how about scary movie"}
{"pred": "System: I think they are.", "label": "System: I think they're done making them"}
{"pred": "System: The new one is called The Last Man, it's a horror movie.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie about a man who is a robot and a robot.", "label": "System: its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal."}
{"pred": "System: You're welcome!", "label": "System: Good glad you like the recommendation."}
{"pred": "System: You're welcome!", "label": "System: you're welcome, enjoy your movie friend."}
{"pred": "System: I have a movie to recommend to you. What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: For sure! What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would like it. I think it's a great movie. I've seen it a few times and it's really funny. I'll have to check it out.", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: So you're a fan of the new Star Wars, right?", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: They're all great, but the other one is the best. I think the other is the one with the guy who plays the main character who is a cop.", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy this movie. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think it is, I love it. I also love the movie The Haunting of the House, which I think is a great movie.", "label": "System: It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
{"pred": "System: I think you might like the movie The Haunting, starring the same guy who directed the original movie. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. It's a great movie. I think it's a little bit of a comedy.", "label": "System: I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like."}

Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend."}
{"pred": "System: They are not really about the characters but rather the characters. They are more about the character's character development.", "label": "System: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything."}

Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real."}

I'm not a big fan of John Wick but I'm a big believer in his work.", "label": "System: Hmm well as for some solid gems on Netflix, check out Tau and Ex Machina they're both sifi but on the dark side.

{"pred": "System: Oldboy is a great one. I think it's a little bit of a thriller.", "label": "System: It has a much more gothic aesthetic and it has a bit less action than oldboy but I would say it's just as good in its own way"}

{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it!", "label": "System: Got it! I recommend <movie>. You seem to like somewhat older/more classic movies. Love Actually is fast paced, as it has multiple plot lines moving at once. There are several plot lines that I find hilarious to break up the more mushy plot lines. It also has a great cast, with actors like Colin Firth and Bill Nighy. How does that sound?"}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it!", "label": "System: Yes, he's great in this movie! My favorite part of the movie is the washed up pop star who keeps forgetting the lyrics to his own songs haha. And two porn stars who fall in love!

{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. It is a great movie.", "label": "System: The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it.

{"pred": "System: Yes, I love it!", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}
{"pred": "System: I'm not sure if I can recommend a movie for you, but I'm sure you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: Thank you! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy it.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes.

{"pred": "System: I think you would like it.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: It's a comedy with a little romance. It's about a man who is a little man and a little girl.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved."}

{"pred": "System: I think it's coming out in 2019.", "label": "System: I think they're done making them"}
{"pred": "System: The new one is a good one.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie about a man who is a doctor and he's a doctor.", "label": "System: its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal."}

{"pred": "System: I love Knives out. It was a great movie. I think you'll like it.", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: Yeah, I'm not a fan of the new Star Wars movies. I think the new ones are a little bit better.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: They're all great, but the other one is a little bit of a different story. I think the other is the one about the guy who's a cop and the other guy is a cop.", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}

I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
{"pred": "System: I think you would be able to find the trailer for it. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though."}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it. It's a great movie. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like."}

{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it! Have a great day!", "label": "System: Great I hope you like it!"}
{"pred": "System: It's not a very good movie. It's more of a comedy.", "label": "System: That movie stars Adam Sandler in a somewhat dramatic role, so I'd recommend another one of his more serious movies as well, like <movie> or Punch-Drunk Love"}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like them! I hope they are as good as the original.", "label": "System: Great! I think most of them are on Netflix as well!"}

Highly recommend."}
{"pred": "System: They are not a lot of things that are more interesting than a good story.", "label": "System: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything."}
{"pred": "System: I would say that would be a good movie. I think the movie is a little more of a thriller than a horror movie.", "label": "System: <movie> was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real."}

I'm not a fan of the plot but I'm sure you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: Hmm well as for some solid gems on Netflix, check out Tau and Ex Machina they're both sifi but on the dark side.

{"pred": "System: Yes, I think that's a great choice. I think you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: It's a little underwhelming actually. Have you seen <movie> thou? The music is really good on that one and the tone is very similar to Sympathy for Mr Vengeance"}

His awesome 80s hit <movie> or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. I think it's a great movie.", "label": "System: The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it. I forgot to mention his other hit <movie>! Its such a great 80s film demonstrating his cheesy yet entertaining acting. Set in the future as a regular working guy, he decides to enter a virtual world type place where he lives a fantasy life of a secret agent. Things go haywire in the process that lead to a crazy action adventure on Mars."}

{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. I think you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: You know what, me either! But the movie captures Batman's humor perfectly. - He's forced to drop is lone vigilante persona and join force with other superheros to beat the <movie> from taking over Gotham."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think so!", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}
{"pred": "System: I think I'll have to check out the trailer for this one. It's a little bit of a spoiler.", "label": "System: Thank you! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: Ok, I will do it", "label": "System: Do you enjoy superhero movies? I can suggest a few that fit your preference"}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend <movie>. It is a superhero movie with a lot of action and action", "label": "System: Suicide squad from 2016 is pretty good and involves a romantic plotline, If you haven't seen The Amazing Spiderman i also suggest that. I most recentyly watched Spiderman: Into the Spider verse"}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend <movie>. It is a superhero movie with a romance plotline and a romance element.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes. Other than that Avengers: infinity wars has many characters but ultimatley has a good romantic plot as well. i suggest both for sure. I'll recommend <movie> trailer though."}

{"pred": "System: What is the last movie that you watched?", "label": "System: What was the last movie you two saw together, did she enjoy it?"}

{"pred": "System: I think I would recommend <movie>. It's about a group of friends who are in a relationship with a girl and they're trying to get together.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. I think it's a little more of a comedy than a comedy.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved."}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad I could help.", "label": "System: Great, I really hope you two enjoy whatever you decide to see! I'll send the trailer for <movie> straight away, bye and take care."}

{"pred": "System: I would say it's better than the original.", "label": "System: I would say <movie>. Letters from Iwo Jima has more of a character focus if that makes sense."}

{"pred": "System: That's a great movie. I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: If you're a fan of Adam Sandler, I would recommend one of my favorites of his, <movie>."}
{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: And for a Will Ferrell movie, you can't go wrong with Anchorman or <movie>. Two classics."}
{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: Alright, let me get you a formal recommendation for <movie>. Thank you for letting me help you today."}
{"pred": "System: What kind of movies do you like?", "label": "System: I'm going to ask you a few questions about movies that you have watched in order to pick a movie trailer that's best for you. Is that okay?"}

{"pred": "System: You too!", "label": "System: Yeah ok <movie>! Well Soon"}
{"pred": "System: No, I don't like horror. What is the last horror movie you watched?", "label": "System: Have you heard of the boy 2"}
{"pred": "System: I have seen the second one, <movie>, and the first was <movie>. I really liked it.", "label": "System: Oh what did you like about it? I think you will like this one if you liked the last."}
{"pred": "System: Yes it is from the director of the original Ghostbusters.", "label": "System: yes William Brent Bell was the director from the first as well."}
{"pred": "System: I think the trailer is from the director of the first movie.", "label": "System: No problem!"}
{"pred": "System: I have seen the new <movie>, which is a horror movie.", "label": "System: how about scary movie"}
{"pred": "System: I think it will be a new movie.", "label": "System: I think they're done making them"}
{"pred": "System: The trailer for <movie> was great.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie about a man who is a robot and his job is to save the world.", "label": "System: its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal."}
{"pred": "System: you too!", "label": "System: Good glad you like the recommendation."}

{"pred": "System: I think you would really enjoy it. I think I have a few recommendations for you.", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: Yeah, I think I'll have to agree with you on that one. I think you'll like it. I really enjoyed the movie.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: <movie>, <movie>?", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. I think I have a few more things I would recommend you to see.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think it is, I love it. I also love the movie that is directed by Quentin Tarantino.", "label": "System: It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
{"pred": "System: I think I have seen the trailer, but I don't remember the name of the movie. I think it's called The Haunting, which is a horror movie.", "label": "System: Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like."}

{"pred": "System: yes, it is a great movie.", "label": "System: In my opinion, it's the second funniest after the original movie."}
{"pred": "System: I think <movie> is a great movie. It's a great film.", "label": "System: I'm not as big a fan of comic book movies, but i've heard bloodshot is supposed to be really good."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, it is!", "label": "System: yup, that's the one"}
{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: ok cool...do you think you'd prefer bad boys or bloodshot?"}
{"pred": "System: I hear you're looking for a movie trailer. Do you have any specific genre you like to see?", "label": "System: What kind of movies do you like?"}
{"pred": "System: I can't really understand why you don't like movies with a lot of dialog, but I do like the action scenes. What is the last movie you watched?", "label": "System: I would recommend any of the Marvel superhero movies for adventure."}

{"pred": "System: It's about a family that is in a relationship with a vampire.", "label": "System: Great I hope you like it!"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I do. I think it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.", "label": "System: That movie stars Adam Sandler in a somewhat dramatic role, so I'd recommend another one of his more serious movies as well, like <movie> or Punch-Drunk Love"}

{"pred": "System: I would recommend watching the trailer for <movie>, it's a little short but it's very good and has a great plot.", "label": "System: <movie> series is one of my favorites.

{"pred": "System: I think you'll like <movie>, it's a little bit of a drama and a little of a comedy.", "label": "System: Got it! I recommend <movie>. You seem to like somewhat older/more classic movies. Love Actually is fast paced, as it has multiple plot lines moving at once. There are several plot lines that I find hilarious to break up the more mushy plot lines. It also has a great cast, with actors like Colin Firth and Bill Nighy. How does that sound?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. It's a great movie.", "label": "System: Yes, he's great in this movie! My favorite part of the movie is the washed up pop star who keeps forgetting the lyrics to his own songs haha. And two porn stars who fall in love!

{"pred": "System: It's a shame that the scientists are not as good as the scientists.", "label": "System: I couldn't possibly agree with that statement anymore than I do right now. Scientists present facts that people choose to ignore and it's very disheartening."}

His awesome 80s hit <movie> or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. I think I will watch it again.", "label": "System: The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it. I forgot to mention his other hit <movie>! Its such a great 80s film demonstrating his cheesy yet entertaining acting. Set in the future as a regular working guy, he decides to enter a virtual world type place where he lives a fantasy life of a secret agent. Things go haywire in the process that lead to a crazy action adventure on Mars."}

{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy it.

{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. I think you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: You know what, me either! But the movie captures Batman's humor perfectly. - He's forced to drop is lone vigilante persona and join force with other superheros to beat the <movie> from taking over Gotham."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think so.", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}
{"pred": "System: I think you'll like it. It's a little bit of a slow start but it's a great movie.", "label": "System: Thank you! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: I think you would like this movie.", "label": "System: Do you enjoy superhero movies? I can suggest a few that fit your preference"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would like this movie.", "label": "System: Suicide squad from 2016 is pretty good and involves a romantic plotline, If you haven't seen The Amazing Spiderman i also suggest that. I most recentyly watched Spiderman: Into the Spider verse"}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend <movie>. It has a very similar plot to the movie.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes. Other than that Avengers: infinity wars has many characters but ultimatley has a good romantic plot as well. i suggest both for sure. I'll recommend <movie> trailer though."}

{"pred": "System: What was the last movie that you watched?", "label": "System: What was the last movie you two saw together, did she enjoy it?"}
{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy this movie. It's about a young girl who is a young woman and is trying to make a move to become a superhero.", "label": "System: Haha, ok. Are you looking for more of a general comedy film or something perhaps more romantic?"}

{"pred": "System: I think I can do that.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: It's a comedy with a lot of action and action. It's about a young girl who is a young woman who is in love with a young boy.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved."}

{"pred": "System: I think it's coming out in the next few days.", "label": "System: I think they're done making them"}
{"pred": "System: <movie> is a great horror movie.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie about a man who is a serial killer.", "label": "System: its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal."}

{"pred": "System: I think you would really enjoy it. I think I've seen it a few times, but it's always funny. Have you seen the trailer for the movie <movie>?", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: Yeah, I think you'll love it. I think I'll check out the trailer for the first one, but it's not a lot. I'll probably watch it again.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: <movie>, <movie>?", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I agree, I think you'll enjoy it. I think I'll give it a shot.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think it's one of my favorites.", "label": "System: It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
{"pred": "System: I think I have a few, but I'll have to check again. I'll take a look at the trailer.", "label": "System: Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though."}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it. It's a great movie. I'm sure you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like."}

{"pred": "System: <movie>, <movie>", "label": "System: That movie stars Adam Sandler in a somewhat dramatic role, so I'd recommend another one of his more serious movies as well, like <movie> or Punch-Drunk Love"}

Highly recommend."}

Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them.

{"pred": "System: I agree. I love the way he portrays the characters in this movie.", "label": "System: I agree completely! His work in movies so serious, such as Captain Philips, and animated children's films, such as the <movie> movie, shows how versatile he can be."}

His awesome 80s hit <movie> or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. I think the first one is a little bit better than the second.", "label": "System: The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it. I forgot to mention his other hit <movie>! Its such a great 80s film demonstrating his cheesy yet entertaining acting. Set in the future as a regular working guy, he decides to enter a virtual world type place where he lives a fantasy life of a secret agent. Things go haywire in the process that lead to a crazy action adventure on Mars."}

She is a woman in a relationship with a man who is not a fan.", "label": "System: It is of course based on the 1925 Novel written by F.Scott Fitsgerald. The original film version was lost but the movie has been redone several times and as recent as 2013 staring Leonardo Dicaprio. I would defiantly check it out."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. It is a classic of a true classic.", "label": "System: Yes, A writer and wall street trader finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor, Jay Gatsby.

{"pred": "System: It's a great movie. I think you'll like it.", "label": "System: You know what, me either! But the movie captures Batman's humor perfectly. - He's forced to drop is lone vigilante persona and join force with other superheros to beat the <movie> from taking over Gotham."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think so.", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}
{"pred": "System: I'm not sure if I'm up to date on the time scale but I'm sure it'll be something interesting.", "label": "System: Thank you! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: Ok, I will do it.", "label": "System: Do you enjoy superhero movies? I can suggest a few that fit your preference"}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend <movie>. It has a very good cast of actors and a great cast of characters.", "label": "System: Suicide squad from 2016 is pretty good and involves a romantic plotline, If you haven't seen The Amazing Spiderman i also suggest that. I most recentyly watched Spiderman: Into the Spider verse"}
{"pred": "System: I would recommend <movie>. It is a superhero movie with a romance and romance element.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes. Other than that Avengers: infinity wars has many characters but ultimatley has a good romantic plot as well. i suggest both for sure. I'll recommend <movie> trailer though."}

{"pred": "System: I think you will like it.", "label": "System: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and <movie>."}
{"pred": "System: I think I would recommend <movie>.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: It's a comedy with a lot of action. It's about a young girl who is a young woman who is in love with a young boy.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved."}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy it! I hope it is a good one.", "label": "System: Great, I really hope you two enjoy whatever you decide to see! I'll send the trailer for <movie> straight away, bye and take care."}

{"pred": "System: I have seen the trailer for <movie>, which is a horror movie.", "label": "System: how about scary movie"}
{"pred": "System: I think it's from the beginning of the movie.", "label": "System: I think they're done making them"}
{"pred": "System: The trailer for the first was great.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie about a man who is a robot and he's a robot.", "label": "System: its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal."}

I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: Yeah, I think I'd recommend watching the trailer for <movie>. It's a little bit of a snappy action movie.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: <movie>, <movie>?", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy this movie. It's about a gang of friends that are trying to make a living in the world of crime.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think it's one of my favorites. I'm also a huge Tarantino fan.", "label": "System: It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
{"pred": "System: I think I have seen it, but I don't remember the name. I'll have to look it up.", "label": "System: Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though."}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it. It's a great movie. I'm sure you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like."}

{"pred": "System: The health ledger", "label": "System: The most recent movie. It's just called '<movie>'. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend."}
{"pred": "System: They are not really about the same people. They are more about the characters and the characters.", "label": "System: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything."}
{"pred": "System: I would say that's a little bit of both. I think the movie is more like a comic book with a little more action and a little romance.", "label": "System: <movie> was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real."}

I think I will watch it again.", "label": "System: Hmm well as for some solid gems on Netflix, check out Tau and Ex Machina they're both sifi but on the dark side.

The film absolutely does not agree with any of the negative views that some characters exemplify."}

It is a little bit of a slow start but it's a great movie.", "label": "System: So I got two awesome choices you can tell me, which you prefer to hear more about. His awesome 80s hit <movie> or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will like it. I think the first one is a little bit better than the second.", "label": "System: The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it. I forgot to mention his other hit <movie>! Its such a great 80s film demonstrating his cheesy yet entertaining acting. Set in the future as a regular working guy, he decides to enter a virtual world type place where he lives a fantasy life of a secret agent. Things go haywire in the process that lead to a crazy action adventure on Mars."}

{"pred": "System: It's a classic! It's about a woman who is a great lover of her husband. She is a woman in a relationship with a man who is not a fan.", "label": "System: It is of course based on the 1925 Novel written by F.Scott Fitsgerald. The original film version was lost but the movie has been redone several times and as recent as 2013 staring Leonardo Dicaprio. I would defiantly check it out."}
{"pred": "System: I think you would enjoy it. It is a classic of a true classic.", "label": "System: Yes, A writer and wall street trader finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor, Jay Gatsby.

{"pred": "System: It's a great movie! It's about a group of people who are trying to make a living as a superhero.", "label": "System: You know what, me either! But the movie captures Batman's humor perfectly. - He's forced to drop is lone vigilante persona and join force with other superheros to beat the <movie> from taking over Gotham."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think so, but I'm not sure yet.", "label": "System: It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the outsider of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated."}
{"pred": "System: I'm not sure if you're into that kind, but I'm open to suggestions. I'm a big fan of the animated movies.", "label": "System: Thank you! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?"}

{"pred": "System: I would recommend <movie>. It is a superhero movie with a romance plotline and a romance element.", "label": "System: I think <movie> would be a good bet in terms of superheroes.

{"pred": "System: I think you will like it.", "label": "System: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and <movie>."}
{"pred": "System: I think I can do that.", "label": "System: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested."}
{"pred": "System: It's a little known fact that the movie is based on a true story.", "label": "System: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht.

{"pred": "System: The trailer for the first was great.", "label": "System: how about <movie>?"}
{"pred": "System: It's a horror movie about a man who is a robot and his wife is a vampire.", "label": "System: its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal."}

{"pred": "System: I think I've seen that one. It's a really good movie. I think you'd really enjoy it.", "label": "System: I absolutely loved <movie>. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest <movie> film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself."}
{"pred": "System: Yeah, I think I'll have to agree with you on that one. I think you'll be able too see the movie.", "label": "System: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind."}
{"pred": "System: <movie>, <movie>?", "label": "System: Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled <movie>. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece."}
{"pred": "System: I think you will enjoy it. I think I have a few more movies to check out.", "label": "System: I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I think it's one of my favorites. I think the movie is a little bit too dark for my taste.", "label": "System: It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found."}
{"pred": "System: I think I have a few, but I'm sure I'll look into it.", "label": "System: Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though."}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you like it. It's a great movie. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like."}

{"pred": "System: yes it is very funny", "label": "System: In my opinion, it's the second funniest after the original movie."}
{"pred": "System: i think <movie> is a great movie. It's a great comedy.", "label": "System: I'm not as big a fan of comic book movies, but i've heard bloodshot is supposed to be really good."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, Vin Diesel is a great actor.", "label": "System: yup, that's the one"}
{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it!", "label": "System: ok cool...do you think you'd prefer bad boys or bloodshot?"}
{"pred": "System: I understand that you are looking for a movie?", "label": "System: What kind of movies do you like?"}
{"pred": "System: I can't really understand why. What was the last movie you saw?", "label": "System: I would recommend any of the Marvel superhero movies for adventure."}

{"pred": "System: Great! I hope you enjoy it! I think you'll enjoy it.", "label": "System: Great I hope you like it!"}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I do!", "label": "System: That movie stars Adam Sandler in a somewhat dramatic role, so I'd recommend another one of his more serious movies as well, like <movie> or Punch-Drunk Love"}
{"pred": "System: I hope I can help you find a movie you like!", "label": "System: Great! I think most of them are on Netflix as well!"}
{"pred": "System: I'm glad you're enjoying it! I hope it's as good as the first one!", "label": "System: 50 First Dates is another I'd recommend"}
{"pred": "System: I do, but I'm not sure if they are available in Netflix.", "label": "System: Yeah, if you like comedies, I'd also recommend The Disaster Artist, it's a comedy based on the making of the movie The Room, which is widely regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. It's pretty funny!"}
{"pred": "System: I think it's about a guy who was in a movie called The Room. It was a great movie!", "label": "System: James Franco, Dave Franco, and Seth Rogen"}
